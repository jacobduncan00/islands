# Islands

Based off one of the most popular graph interview question [Number of Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/). This single page web application allows you to run my DFS algorithm under the hood and visualize the islands on a grid you define!
Note: This implementation does take into consideration diagonals when running my DFS algorithm.
